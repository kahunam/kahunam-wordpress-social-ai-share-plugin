# How to Report Bugs or Request Features

Thank you for helping improve our project! Here's how to report issues or suggest new features.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Go to the [Issues tab](../../issues) in this repository
2. Click the green **"New issue"** button
3. Choose:
   - **🐛 Bug Report** - Something is broken
   - **✨ Feature Request** - You want something new

## 🐛 Reporting a Bug

**Title:** Keep it short and specific
- ❌ "It doesn't work"
- ✅ "Login button doesn't respond on mobile"

**Description:** Tell us:
1. **What happened?** - What went wrong?
2. **What should happen?** - What did you expect?
3. **How to see the bug?** - Steps to reproduce it

**Label**
Please use:
Bug

### Bug Example:
Title: Search bar returns no results for valid products
What happened:
When I search for "blue shirt" nothing shows up, even though we have blue shirts in stock.
What should happen:
Search results should show all blue shirts available.
How to see the bug:

Go to the homepage
Type "blue shirt" in the search bar
Press Enter
See empty results page


## ✨ Requesting a Feature

**Title:** Start with an action verb
- ❌ "Improvement needed"
- ✅ "Add dark mode to user settings"

**Description:** Tell us:
1. **What do you want?** - Describe the feature
2. **Why do you need it?** - The problem it solves
3. **How would it work?** - Your vision (optional)

### Feature Example:
Title: Add export to Excel button for sales reports
What do you want:
A button that lets me download the monthly sales report as an Excel file.
Why do you need it:
I need to share sales data with accounting, and they only use Excel. Currently I have to copy-paste everything manually which takes 30 minutes.
How would it work:
Next to the "Print" button, add an "Export to Excel" button that downloads the current view.

## 📝 Tips for Clear Communication

### DO:
- Be specific about locations ("Settings page > Profile section")
- Include error messages you see (copy-paste them)
- One issue per ticket (don't combine multiple bugs)
- Check if someone already reported it (search existing issues)

### DON'T:
- Use technical jargon you're unsure about
- Assume we know your workflow - explain it!
- Be vague ("fix the thing that's broken")
- Combine multiple requests in one issue

## Need Help?

If you're unsure about anything, just do your best! We'd rather have an imperfect report than no report at all. We'll ask questions if we need more info.
